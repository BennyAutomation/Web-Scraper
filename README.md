# Finance WebScraper using HtmlUnit

I like to stay on top of Elon Musk's latest and greatest so I thought a great way to do that would be to follow Tesla's stock performace.

I used HtmlUnit to scrape Tesla's stock information. With some quick parsing, the most important information is retrieved and displayed.

NOTE: This project could be expanded in a number of ways. For example, it could return the information of multiple stocks instead of just the one, or use 
Jenkins to send a timed email with the info.

Tools Used:
- HtmlUnit
